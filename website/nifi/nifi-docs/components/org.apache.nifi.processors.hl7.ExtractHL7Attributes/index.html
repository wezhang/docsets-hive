The attributes are named as &lt;Segment Name&gt; &lt;dot&gt; &lt;Field Index&gt;. If the segment is repeating, the naming will be &lt;Segment Name&gt; &lt;underscore&gt; &lt;Segment Index&gt; &lt;dot&gt; &lt;Field Index&gt;. For example, we may have an attribute named "MHS.12" with a value of "2.1" and an attribute named "OBX_11.3" with a value of "93000^CPT4".</p><h3>Tags: </h3><p>HL7, health level 7, healthcare, extract, attributes</p><h3>Properties: </h3><p>In the list below, the names of required properties appear in <strong>bold</strong>.
