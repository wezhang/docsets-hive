Each line in an incoming FlowFile is compared against the values specified by user-defined Properties. The mechanism by which the text is compared to these user-defined properties is defined by the 'Matching Strategy'. The data is then routed according to these rules, routing each line of the text individually.</p><h3>Tags: </h3><p>attributes, routing, text, regexp, regex, Regular Expression, Expression Language</p><h3>Properties: </h3><p>In the list below, the names of required properties appear in <strong>bold</strong>.

Two lines will not be placed into the same FlowFile unless the they both have the same value for the Group (or neither line matches the Regular Expression). For example, to group together all lines in a CSV File by the first column, we can set this value to "(.*?),.*". Two lines that have the same Group but different Relationships will never be placed into the same FlowFile.</td></tr></table><h3>Dynamic Properties: </h3><p>Dynamic Properties allow the user to specify both the name and value of a property.<table id="dynamic-properties"><tr><th>Name</th><th>Value</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td id="name">Relationship Name</td><td id="value">value to match against</td><td>Routes data that matches the value specified in the Dynamic Property Value to the Relationship specified in the Dynamic Property Key.</td></tr></table></p><h3>Relationships: </h3><table id="relationships"><tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td>original</td><td>The original input file will be routed to this destination when the lines have been successfully routed to 1 or more relationships</td></tr><tr><td>unmatched</td><td>Data that does not satisfy the required user-defined rules will be routed to this Relationship</td></tr></table><h3>Dynamic Relationships: </h3><p>A Dynamic Relationship may be created based on how the user configures the Processor.<table id="dynamic-relationships"><tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td>Name from Dynamic Property</td><td>FlowFiles that match the Dynamic Property's value</td></tr></table></p><h3>Reads Attributes: </h3>None specified.<h3>Writes Attributes: </h3>None specified.</body></html>
